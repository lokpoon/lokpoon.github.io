I study behavioral ecology of the nocturnal Neotropical electric fish (including the electric eel) through understanding their electric and visual senses. These fish sense the their environment mainly with the electrical sense, something we human can not intuitively comprehend. The electric signals generated by these fish makes it possible for me to quantify their foraging activity with high precision.

The research question I am interested in is when should an animal forage. Animals are constantly making foraging decision based on a complex assortment of factors, especially energetic need and predation risk.

During my PhD dissertation, I discovered that electric fish foraging time depends on external factors (e.g., moonlight and daylight) and internal factors (e.g., body condition and age). Most notably, skinny fish override an innate fear of moonlight to forage under high predation risk.

I approach these questions through field observational studies and lab experiments, using novel equipment and software developed myself and co-developed in Crampton Lab.
