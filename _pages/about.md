I study the behavioral ecology of Neotropical electric fish, focusing on their electric and visual senses. These intriguing nocturnal fish predominantly sense their environment with an active electrosensory system, something we humans cannot intuitively comprehend. Their unique electric signals enable me to precisely quantify foraging activity, thus facilitating the investigation of various ecological questions.

Animals are perpetually making foraging decisions based on a complex assortment of factors, including energetic needs and predation risks. I am interested in how animals make these decisions under interacting circumstances, often involving trade-offs.

During my PhD dissertation, I discovered that the foraging times of electric fish depend on both external factors (e.g., moonlight and daylight) and internal factors (e.g., body condition and age). Most notably, fish in poor body condition override their innate fear of moonlight to forage under conditions of high predation risk.

I approach these questions through both field observational studies and lab experiments. I enjoy doing field work in tropical rainforest, keeping captive fish, and developing research tools. Much of my work involves using novel equipment and software that I developed independently, as well as those co-developed in the Crampton Lab.
