# Sensory ecology
## Electric signals
 
Pulse type electric fish (Teleostei, Gymnotiformes) discharge discrete electric signals at constant rates. The rate of the discharge, pulse rate, serves as a proxy for their sensory sampling rate. Although there is an overlap in pulse rates among species, distinct pulse rate traits are apparent within a community even within the same genus. These traits encompass the absolute day/night rate, day/night rate difference, stability, and rate modulation features. I have documented pulse rate traits from 20 species of pulse-type gymnotiforms to understand the behavioral diversity.

## Dim light vision

Most gymnotiforms have poor visual acuity because they rely predominantly on the electric sense to navigate in darkness. However, they still have eyes and are very sensitive to low light levels, as nighttime light is associated with increased predation risk from visuall orientated predators (e.g. night heron). I quantified the low light sensitivity of various species through behavioral response. Intriguingly, one large eye species does not avoid increased moonlight, suggesting it might be both visually and electrically oriented. This is fascinating because it indicates a lack of the sensory trade-off typical of other gymnotiforms.

# Behavioral ecology
## Temporal landscape of fear

Foraging is necessary but dangerous, therefore the trade-off decision between foraging and hiding is crucial for survival. 
Predation risk and food availability often varies over time, leading to a temporal landscape of fear analogous to spatial heterogeneity. Utilizing electric signal loggers designed in our lab, I documented the movement activity of a community of gymnotiforms in an Amazon rainforest stream over a moonlight cycle. Additionally, I replicated an experiment with captive fish by re-creating the moonlight cycle.

## Chronobiology

Many biological rhythms are endogenous, such as the circadian activity rhythm. Endogenous rhythm, once entrained, can sustain itself without relying on external cues to time biological events. Evidence of an endogenous lunar rhythm in foraging has been scarce, as such a rhythm would be complex due to the daily delay in moonrise/set times. However, I found indications of an endogenous lunar foraging rhythm, where the fish "anticipate" the timing of moonrise even before sunset.

## State-dependent risk taking

While foraging is particularly dangerous during certain times (e.g., full moon), some individuals still engage in it due to the lack of better alternatives option. I investigated how body condition guide the behavioral decision of risk-taking. As a simple anaology, a poor man that is starving have no choice but to steal food (risk taking).I discovered that individuals subjected to caloric restriction override the fear of moonlight as soon as their body condition falls below the average. In other words, individuals who are "behind schedule" in growth compensate by increasing foraging time, even under moonlight.

## Behavioral evolution
Given the diversity in electric signals among the pulse-type gymnotiforms (comprising 20 species in three families), I plan to apply ancestral state reconstruction to investigate the pattern of pulse rate trait diversity. The main hypotheses are that pulse rate traits exhibit phylogenetic inertia, and that a trade-off exists between pulse rate, signal duration, and signal amplitude.
