# Sensory ecology
## Electric signals
Pulse-type electric fish generate discrete electric signals at constant rates. The pulse rate serves as a proxy for their sensory sampling rate. Although there is an overlap in pulse rates among species, distinct pulse rate traits are apparent even within the same genus. These traits encompass the absolute day/night rate, day/night rate difference, stability, and rate modulation features. I have documented pulse rate traits from 20 species of pulse-type gymnotiforms to understand the behavioral diversity.

Most gymnotiforms have poor visual acuity because the electric sense enables them to navigate in darkness. However, they still have eyes and are very sensitive to low light levels, as nighttime light is associated with increased predation risk. I quantified the low light sensitivity of several species through behavioral response. Intriguingly, one species with larger eyes does not avoid increased moonlight, suggesting it might be both visually and electrically oriented. This is fascinating because it indicates a lack of the sensory trade-off typical of other gymnotiforms.

# Behavioral ecology
## Temporal landscape of fear
Foraging is necessary but dangerous, therefore the trade-off decision between foraging and hiding is crucial for survival. Predation risk and food availability often fluctuate over time, leading to a temporal landscape of fear analogous to spatial heterogeneity. Utilizing electric signal loggers designed in our lab, I documented the movement activity of a community of gymnotiforms in an Amazon rainforest stream over a moonlight cycle. Additionally, I replicated an experiment with captive fish by re-creating the moonlight cycle.

## Chronobiology
Many biological rhythms are endogenous, such as the circadian activity rhythm. Endogenous rhythm, once entrained, can sustain itself without relying on external cues to time biological events. Evidence of an endogenous lunar rhythm in foraging has been scarce, as such a rhythm would be complex due to the daily delay in moonrise/set times. However, I found indications of an endogenous lunar foraging rhythm, where the fish "anticipate" the timing of moonrise even before sunset.

## State-dependent risk taking
While foraging is particularly dangerous during certain times (e.g., full moon), some individuals still engage in it due to the lack of better alternatives. I investigated how two "states", body condition and age, guide the behavioral decision of risk-taking. I discovered that individuals subjected to caloric restriction override the fear of moonlight as soon as their body condition falls below the average. In other words, individuals who are "behind schedule" in growth compensate by increasing foraging time, even under moonlight.

## Behavioral evolution
Given the diversity in electric signals among pulse-type gymnotiforms across the phylogeny (comprising 20 species in three families), I plan to apply ancestral state reconstruction to investigate the pattern of pulse rate trait diversity. The main hypotheses are that pulse rate traits exhibit phylogenetic inertia, and that a trade-off exists between pulse rate, signal duration, and signal amplitude.
