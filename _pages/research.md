# Sensory ecology
## Electric signals
 
Electric fish constantly emit species-specific signals that often provide crucial information for species identification. These signals can be continuous sinusoidal waves (wave-type) or discrete waveforms (pulse-type). The discharge rate of pulse-type fish serves as a proxy for sensory sampling rate, allowing long-term monitoring of activity level. Part of my research describes species diversity in pulse rate and its variation over the diurnal cycle, showing that these parameters span a wide range but also overlap strongly among species.

## Dim light vision

Most gymnotiforms have poor visual acuity because they rely predominantly on the electric sense to navigate in darkness. However, they still have eyes and are very sensitive to low light levels, as nighttime light is associated with increased predation risk from visuall orientated predators (e.g. night heron). I quantified the low light sensitivity of various species through behavioral response. Intriguingly, one large eye species does not avoid increased moonlight, suggesting it might be both visually and electrically oriented. This is fascinating because it indicates a lack of the sensory trade-off typical of other gymnotiforms.

# Behavioral ecology
## Temporal landscape of fear

Being nocturnal and relying primarily on active electroreception for navigation and foraging, most gymnotiforms have poor visual acuity, as suggested by their small eyes. The sensory trade-off hypothesis proposes that sensory systems are costly to maintain, limiting the extent to which multiple modalities can be highly developed. Despite this expectation, in shallow, clear rainforest streams I observed substantial interspecific variation in body size–adjusted eye size, suggesting that some species use nighttime vision to supplement electroreception when moonlight is available.

<br/><br/> 

Results from four species showed that larger eyes predicted weaker moonlight avoidance: the largest-eyed species remained active across the lunar cycle, whereas small-eyed species reduced activity during moonlit periods. During dark periods, all species likely rely primarily on electroreception to locate prey. During bright periods, small-eyed species may hide because the short detection range of electroreception limits early predator detection, whereas large-eyed species may remain active by using visual vigilance; the extra foraging time could help meet the energetic costs of maintaining both visual and electrosensory systems.

## Chronobiology

Many biological rhythms are endogenous, such as the circadian activity rhythm. Endogenous rhythm, once entrained, can sustain itself without relying on external cues to time biological events. Evidence of an endogenous lunar rhythm in foraging has been scarce, as such a rhythm would be complex due to the daily delay in moonrise/set times. However, I found indications of an endogenous lunar foraging rhythm, where the fish "anticipate" the timing of moonrise even before sunset.

## State-dependent risk taking

While foraging is particularly dangerous during certain times (e.g., full moon), some individuals still engage in it due to the lack of better alternatives option. I investigated how body condition guide the behavioral decision of risk-taking. As a simple anaology, a poor man that is starving have no choice but to steal food (risk taking).I discovered that individuals subjected to caloric restriction override the fear of moonlight as soon as their body condition falls below the average. In other words, individuals who are "behind schedule" in growth compensate by increasing foraging time, even under moonlight.

## Behavioral evolution
Given the diversity in electric signals among the pulse-type gymnotiforms (comprising 20 species in three families), I plan to apply ancestral state reconstruction to investigate the pattern of pulse rate trait diversity. The main hypotheses are that pulse rate traits exhibit phylogenetic inertia, and that a trade-off exists between pulse rate, signal duration, and signal amplitude.
