# Sensory ecology
## Electric signals
 
Electric fish constantly emit species-specific signals that often provide crucial information for species identification. These signals can be continuous sinusoidal waves (wave-type) or discrete waveforms (pulse-type). The discharge rate of pulse-type fish serves as a proxy for sensory sampling rate, allowing long-term monitoring of activity level. Part of my research describes species diversity in pulse rate and its variation over the diurnal cycle, showing that these parameters span a wide range but also overlap strongly among species.

## Dim light vision

Electric fish are nocturnal and navigate and forage mainly using active electroreception, and many species have small eyes. In shallow, clear rainforest streams, however, eye size varies strongly among species, suggesting that some fishes may use vision at night when moonlight is available. Across four species, larger body size–adjusted eyes predicted weaker moonlight avoidance: the largest-eyed species remained active across the lunar cycle, likely using vision to avoid predators to maintain foraging, whereas small-eyed species reduced activity during moonlit periods. These results highlight the importance of species-specific sensory adaptations for predicting behavior and ecological effects, and they provide insight into sensory trade-offs.

## Temporal landscape of fear — Moonlight

The mere perception of predation risk can strongly influence individuals behavior and drive large-scale population changes. Many nocturanl species percieve moonlight as predation risk, because many visually-oriented predators imrpove hunting success with increased light level. 


# Behavioral ecology


## State-dependent risk taking

While foraging is particularly dangerous during certain times (e.g., full moon), some individuals still engage in it due to the lack of better alternatives option. I investigated how body condition guide the behavioral decision of risk-taking. As a simple anaology, a poor man that is starving have no choice but to steal food (risk taking).I discovered that individuals subjected to caloric restriction override the fear of moonlight as soon as their body condition falls below the average. In other words, individuals who are "behind schedule" in growth compensate by increasing foraging time, even under moonlight.

## Chronobiology

Many biological rhythms are endogenous, such as the circadian activity rhythm. Endogenous rhythm, once entrained, can sustain itself without relying on external cues to time biological events. Evidence of an endogenous lunar rhythm in foraging has been scarce, as such a rhythm would be complex due to the daily delay in moonrise/set times. However, I found indications of an endogenous lunar foraging rhythm, where the fish "anticipate" the timing of moonrise even before sunset.
